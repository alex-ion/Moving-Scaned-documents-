# Moving-Scaned-documents-

Until this script was created, I had to manually move the scanned documents received from 18 rental stations every day. It was meant to move every file from a public folder (for each rental station) within the VPN to a secured folder where only 2 employee had access. The script was schedulled to run once at 3:05 AM when the storage server was idle.
